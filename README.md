Sprocket Central  Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their provided customer dataset using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) to recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the higher value for the company.
